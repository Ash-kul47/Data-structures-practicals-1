Game Development:
write a game development program that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. The
program will simulate a simple game where the player can input a set of numbers,
and the numbers will be sorted using Bubble Sort to simulate a "level-up" scenario
where the player's scores are sorted in ascending order.


Bubble sort : 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int n,temp;
	cout<<"Welcome to sorting game "<<endl;
	cout<<" Number of players are 12 "<<endl;
	n=12;
	
	int players[12];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		cout<<"Enter scores of players :"<<endl;
		cin>>players[i];
	}
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		cout<<" Score of "<<i<< " is "<<players[i]<<endl;	
	}
	//bubble sort
	for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
		for(int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++){
			if(players[j] > players[j + 1]){
				temp = players[j];
				players[j] = players[j + 1];
				players[j + 1] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
	cout<<"sorted array "<<endl;
	for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
		cout<<players[i]<<" "<<endl;
	}
	return 0 ;
}
