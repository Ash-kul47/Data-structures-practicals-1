Arrival: Customers arrive at the coffee shop and stand in line. Order Processing: The
first customer in line gets their order taken, and the barista starts making the
coffee.Serving: Once the first customer is served, they leave the queue, and the next
The customer in line moves forward to be served. Write a program to implement a simple
queue.
